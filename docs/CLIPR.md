CLI Plugin Repository (CLIPR)
=============

CLIPR is a server that the [CloudFoundry CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli) 
can interact with to browse and install plugins. This documentation covers how to run CLIPR itself,
as well as how to create your own implementation if desired.

Running CLIPR
=============

## Running as a Cloud Foundry App

1. `git clone` or `go get` this repo
  - To Git clone, you need to have [git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
    Clone this repo `git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli-plugin-repo`
  
1. Push CLIPR to your instance of Cloud Foundry by doing `cf push` at the root of CLIPR

## Running as a stand alone binary

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org)
1. [Ensure your $GOPATH is set correctly](http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable)
1. Use `go build` to build the binary, here is an example in OSX/Linux which produces an executable called `clipr`
```shell
$ go build -o clipr ./
```
1. Invoke the binary `./clipr` with the following options
  - `-n`: IP Address for the server to listen on, default is `0.0.0.0`
  - `-p`: Port number for the server to listen on, default is `8080`


Once you have a CLIPR server running, either as a Cloud Foundry app or a stand alone server
- Add the running server to your CLI via the `add-plugin-repo` command, for example, `cf add-plugin-repo local-repo http://localhost:8080`
- Browse & install plugins from CLI. Alternatively, you can point your browser at the server address, for example, `http://localhost:8080` to see a listing of plugins

Forking the repository for development
======================================

1. Install [Go](https://golang.org)
1. [Ensure your $GOPATH is set correctly](http://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-GOPATH_environment_variable)
1. Get the CLIPR source code: `go get code.cloudfoundry.org/cli-plugin-repo`
1. Fork the repository
1. Add your fork as a remote: 
```shell
cd $GOPATH/src/code.cloudfoundry.org/cli-plugin-repo
git remote add your_name https://github.com/your_name/cli-plugin-repo
```
  
Creating your own Plugin Repo Server
=============
Alternatively, you can create your own plugin repo implementation. The server must meet the requirements:
- server must have a `/list` endpoint which returns a JSON object that lists the plugin info in the correct form
```json
{"plugins": [
  {
    "name":"echo",
    "description":"echo repeats input back to the terminal",
    "version":"0.1.4",
    "date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "company":"",
    "author":"",
    "contact":"feedback@email.com",
    "homepage":"https://github.com/johndoe/plugin-repo",
    "binaries": [
      {
        "platform":"osx",
        "url":"https://github.com/johndoe/plugin-repo/raw/main/bin/osx/echo",
        "checksum":"2a087d5cddcfb057fbda91e611c33f46"
      },
      {
        "platform":"win64",
        "url":"https://github.com/johndoe/plugin-repo/raw/main/bin/windows64/echo.exe",
        "checksum":"b4550d6594a3358563b9dcb81e40fd66"
      }
    ]
  }
]}
```
