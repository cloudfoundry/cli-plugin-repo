  Please make sure the spacing and colons are correct and that the fields are alphabetized in the entry. The following describes each field's usage.

  Field | Description
  ------ | ---------
  `authors` | Fields to detail the authors of the plugin<br>`name`: name of author<br>`homepage`: **Optional** link to the homepage of the author<br>`contact`: **Optional** ways to contact author, email, twitter, phone etc ...
  `binaries` | This section has fields detailing the various binary versions of your plugin. To reach as large an audience as possible, we encourage contributors to cross-compile their plugins on as many platforms as possible. Go provides everything you need to cross-compile for different platforms<br>`platform`: The os for this binary.

  `version` | version number of your plugin, in [major].[minor].[build] form

1. run `go run sort/main.go repo-index.yml`. This will sort your additions to the file.
1. After making the changes, fork the repository
1. Add your fork as a remote
   ```
   cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/cloudfoundry/cli-plugin-repo
   git remote add your_name https://github.com/your_name/cli-plugin-repo
   ```

1. Push the changes to your fork and submit a Pull Request

## Releasing Plugins

### Cross-compile to the 3 different operating systems

Golang supports cross compilation to several systems and architectures. Theres an in-depth article by Dave Cheney [here](http://dave.cheney.net/2015/08/22/cross-compilation-with-go-1-5) explaining how to do it and how it works. You can also find a list of supported systems and architectures [here](https://golang.org/doc/install/source#environment) under the `$GOOS and $GOARCH` section.

The CF cli supports 5 combinations:
* `linux`/`386` (known as `linux32`)
* `linux`/`amd64` (known as `linux64`)
* `windows`/`386` (known as `win32`)
* `windows`/`amd64` (known as `win64`)
* `darwin `/`amd64` (known as `osx`)

And at a minimum we want plugins to support `linux64`, `win64` and `osx`.

So, with all that, you can generate those binaries for your plugin with the following snippet:

```bash
PLUGIN_PATH=$GOPATH/src/my-plugin
PLUGIN_NAME=$(basename $PLUGIN_PATH)

cd $PLUGIN_PATH
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ${PLUGIN_NAME}.linux64
GOOS=linux GOARCH=386 go build -o ${PLUGIN_NAME}.linux32
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ${PLUGIN_NAME}.win64
GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o ${PLUGIN_NAME}.win32
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o ${PLUGIN_NAME}.osx
```

### Sign Windows binaries
By signing the plugin binary, you can assure recipients that it did indeed come from you.  
Although an optional step, unsigned binaries often cannot be used in locked-down machines common in organizations with stricter security policies. Signing the binary allows system admins to whitelist the plugin by signature or publisher.

The cf CLI binary is signed using a Cloud Foundry Foundation certificate. This certificate cannot be used to sign third-party plugins; plugin authors need to procure their own code-signing certificate. 

You’ll need a code-signing certificate compatible with Microsoft Authenticode issued by a Microsoft-authorized certificate authority such as Thawte, Comodo, Symantec, or Digicert. *A standard code signing certificate is sufficient - extended validation (EV) is not required.* Buying direct from these CAs can be expensive. There are many resellers of certificates that pass on savings they get from volume discounts; you can shop around for a good price or support but fundamentally they’re all selling the same thing. You should expect an average price of between USD 80 and USD 150 for a one-year cert.

Once the certificate is obtained, refer to the following steps to sign your plugin binary.

```bash
CERT_LOCATION=my-cert-location
CERT_PASSWORD=my-cert-password
PLUGIN_BINARY_NAME=my-plugin.win32

mkdir signed-binaries
osslsigncode sign \
  -pkcs12 $CERT_LOCATION \
  -pass $CERT_PASSWORD \
  -t http://timestamp.comodoca.com/authenticode \
  -h sha256 \
  -in ${PLUGIN_BINARY_NAME} \
  -out signed-binaries/${PLUGIN_BINARY_NAME}
rm -f ${PLUGIN_BINARY_NAME}
```

### Checksums

Checksums in the `repo-index.yml` file are used to verify the integrity of the binaries, to prevent corrupted downloads from being installed. We use the [`sha-1`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) checksum algorithm, you can compute it with: `shasum -a 1 <myfile>`

So continuing the above snipped you'd do:

```bash
shasum -a 1 ${PLUGIN_NAME}.linux64
shasum -a 1 ${PLUGIN_NAME}.linux32
shasum -a 1 ${PLUGIN_NAME}.win64
shasum -a 1 ${PLUGIN_NAME}.win32
shasum -a 1 ${PLUGIN_NAME}.osx
```

Take note of those so that you can put them on `repo-index.yml` later when you have uploaded the binaries.

### Release the binary publicly

You could use whatever file hosting you like here, the easiest and recommended one is GitHub releases, given that your plugin's code is already hosted on GitHub it might be the easiest solution too.

You can read more about GitHub Releases [here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) but for the purposes of releasing your plugin you should upload those five binaries generated above on the same release.

You should then copy the resulting links for the uploaded binaries from the release page and put them on the `repo-index.yml` file.

This process can get a little tedious if you do it manually every time, that's why some plugin developers have automated it. You can probably put together scripts based on the snippets above to automate compiling, generating checksums and uploading the release to GitHub. There are tools available to manage GitHub releases such as [this one](https://github.com/aktau/github-release).


## Running your own Plugin Repo Server

Included as part of this repository is the CLI Plugin Repo (CLIPR), a reference implementation of a repo server. For information on how to run CLIPR or how to write your own, [please see the CLIPR documentation here.](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli-plugin-repo/blob/main/docs/CLIPR.md)
